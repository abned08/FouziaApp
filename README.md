# FouziaApp
FouziaApp is a C# desktop application that automates the work of the Disputes Authority of the Real Estate Conservation Directorate. It is built on .NET Framework 4 and uses a local MS SQL database. FouziaApp is easy to use and can help to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the Disputes Authority's work. This was my first desktop app, and I am proud of what I have accomplished.
